# Next.js Workout Track App

This project uses Next.js with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS and Supabase to create a fully featured workout tracking app. Getting this running locally would be a lot of effort due to having to set up all the Supabase stuff and process the data so I do not recommend it.

# TODO
- make exercise table have search option, filter option (by muscle)
- add create routine page
- add log workout page
